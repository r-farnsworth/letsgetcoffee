# Let's Get Coffee!

Project created as part of the [Udacity Front End Nanodegree](http://www.udacity.com).
This map shows the places I most frequently get coffee in my local area: [Headington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headington), which lies to the north east of Oxford city centre. Clicking on the markers takes the user through to the location's entry on FourSquare.

## Installing
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

1. Clone this directory
2. Run `npm install` followed by `npm run start`. The app will be launched automatically.

## APIs
The Google Maps and FourSquare APIs were used in the creation of this app.

## Acknowledgements
* My erstwhile comrades on the Udacity Slack channels; too many to list but their support, advice and feedback has been invaluable
* FourSquare and Google for their APIs
* The establishments marked on the map, for keeping this bedraggled thirtysomething mother-of-two caffeinated
* The (possibly apocryphal) goatherd who discovered coffee. Millions of coders and parents salute you.
